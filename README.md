For this project, I started by creating different dictionaries to organize the patient information based on different ranges and groups of the values. Then, I created a function that takes two inputs and returns the groups of the first input and average or percentage of the second input for each group, based on the metric. For string values, the function returns percentages, for integers or floats, the function returns averages. I created this function to be able to do this analysis with any two patient details that were included in the CSV. Enjoy!
